Description of Project
----------------------

Farm Friends is a social networking application targeted to hobby farmers. It was developed initially as an animal inventory application.
My brother and his wife have a small hobby farm that includes, among other things, about 30 chickens and an equal number of other fowl.
They needed a way to both keep a list of the animals so that they (or others helping them) new at a glance what they had. Additionally, 
they wanted to be able to note the chickens' personalities and to compare what they looked like as chicks to what they looked like as adults: 
Did they lose spots? Did their feathers change color?

As the concept was developed, I decided to add in the social networking component as well. Several other of their friends also have small
farms. This allows them to keep each other updated on what animals are new to their flocks and herds and engage in conversation about the
animals.
